Plugin to synchronize a wordpress blog with an OJS source through the OJS REST plugin

== Description ==

This plugin reads JSON from an OJS site through its REST plugin.  Articles are imported as wordpress posts.

By modifying the ojsimport-mapping.php file, you can map other forms of data from OJS (e.g. announcements, issues)
to different forms of content in wordpress (e.g. pages).

This plugin is based on the work from the SMW Import plugin (wordpress.org/extend/plugins/smw-import/) by Christoph Herbst.


== Installation ==

1. Upload `ojs-import` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add data sources in the admin page
4. Edit and adjust the mapping in the `ojsimport-mapping.php` file
5. Run the import from the tools page
